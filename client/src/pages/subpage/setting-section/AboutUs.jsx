      <p>Welcome To Denoter !</p>
      <p>
        Denoter, or definitely not twitter, is a simple social media platform
        where users can post ideas and images. Users can also follow others to
        keep up with what others are doing. The app itself is only used for
        learning purposes and as a personal project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The software aims to let users share their ideas online and let others
        find out more about them. The idea for the website is taken from
        twitter, hence the name, and is used as a personal project with no
        commercial purposes.
